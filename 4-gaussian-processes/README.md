Instructions

Re-do the second part of your linear regression assignment (i.e. the replication of figure 3.8) with Gaussian processes. 
This basically involves replacing your prediction equations (3.58 and 3.59) with the GP predictions (6.66 and 6.67). 
Use the Gaussian kernel (eqn 6.23) to build the covariance matrix C (eqn 6.62)



Stretch goal, 5 points. Read the Practical Guide to Support Vector Classification paper, implement the grid search procedure on the same datasets you used for project 3
