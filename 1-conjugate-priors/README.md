Instructions
The project is to implement conjugate estimators for the following scenarios:

 

Binomial 

Gaussian with known variance (i.e. estimate the mean)

Gaussian with known mean (i.e. estimate the variance)

 

You should plot the mean squared error both the ML and conjugate prior estimates, all on one plot, with a legend. For each scenario, choose 2-3 different values for the hyper parameters. 

 

Additionally, for at least one set of hyperparameter per scenario, plot the posterior density as it changes with observations. The easy way to do this is to just plot the pdf a few times, for different #s of observations.


Stretch Goal #1: Make a movie showing the posterior converge (2 points)
Stretch Goal #2: Implement the conjugate prior estimator for the unknown mean and variance case. Plot the pdf as it changes as in the first part. Note this will be a 3-Dim pdf, so use a heatmap or someting similar. (3 points)
