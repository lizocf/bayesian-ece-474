Instructions

Implement EM on a Gaussian mixture model in 1 and 2 dimensions. 

For the 1-D case, use K = 3, the choice of means, covariance and pi is up to you.  The algorithm is laid out explicitly in equations 9.23-9.28.

 

Produce a plot that shows a histogram of your generated observations, and overlay on that histogram the pdf you found. Plot this at algorithm init, and a couple other times as the algorithm converges. If you feel ambitious make a movie. If you want to see the algorithm break, artificially introduce a data point that exactly equals one of the means of the distribution.

 

For 2-D, create a plot similar to 9.8. Use the old faitfhul dataset and K = 2.
