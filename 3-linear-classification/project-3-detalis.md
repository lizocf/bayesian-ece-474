Instructions
 

 Generate a dataset for yourself consisting of 2 classes from a multivariate normal distribution. Mu1 = [1 1], Mu2 = [-1 -1], Sigma = eye(1). Implement two different linear classifiers on this data, a Gaussian generative model, and a logistic regression classifier. For the logistic regression classifier, you must implement the IRLS algorithm.

 

Report your % correct classification (it should be very high for this simple dataset). 

 

Plot a ROC curve for both of your classifiers, Plot the decision boundary for both your classifiers (hint, it should be a line)

 

Go to Kaggle or the UCI machine learning database, find a dataset that interests you, and try your classifiers on it. Make sure it is a binary dataset with only numerical features.
